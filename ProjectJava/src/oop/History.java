Eventually it would split into \ntwo-Gour (Sylhet) and Brahmachal (South Sylhet/modern-day Moulvibazar). The region was also home to many petty kingdoms such as\nLaur and day Moulvibazar). The region was also home to many petty kingdoms such as Laur and the Raja of Tripura Dharma Fa planned a\nceremony and invited five Brahmans from Etawah, Mithila and Kannauj.

In the early medieval period, the area was dominated by Hindu \nprincipalities, which were under the nominal suzerainty of the Senas and Devas.\n\nAfter the death of Raja Upananda of Brahmachal (modern-day Baramchal, Kulaura), Govardhan of Gour allowed Amar Singh to rule over\nsouthern Sylhet. Singh was unable to cope and died shortly after. The Kuki chiefs then annexed Brahmachal (Southern Sylhet) to the \nTwipra Kingdom ruled by Ratan Manikya. Jaidev Rai was appointed to govern Brahmachal under the Tripura king. The penultimate Raja\nGovardhan of Gour was killed in a battle against Kuki rebels and the Jaintia Kingdom in 1260. He would be succeeded by his nephew, our\nGovinda, who would reunite Northern Sylhet (Gour) and Southern Sylhet (Brahmachal). Govinda dismissed Govardhan's chief minister\nMadan Rai and appointed Mona Rai as his minister instead.\n");

Ghiyasuddin Iwaz Shah, the\ngovernor of Bengal who later claimed independence from Delhi, carried out invasions into neighbouring regions such as Assam, Tripura, \nBihar and Sylhet and making them his tributary states. In 1254, Governor of  Bengal Malik Ikhtiyaruddin Iuzbak invaded the Azmardan\n Raj (present-day Ajmiriganj). He defeated the local Raja, and plundered his wealth. \n\nThe Raja of Laur, Ramnath (descendant of Keshab Misra), had three sons with only one remaining in central Laur. Ramnath's second son,\nDurbar Khan, migrated to Jagannathpur to build his own palace. He later seized his youngest brother, Gobind Singh's, territory in Baniachong. \n\n\nSonargaon rule:\n\nThe Delhi Sultanate's control of Bengal gradually weakened as rebel governors declared independence. During the early 14th-century, Bengal \nwas divided between three small sultanates- Sonargaon in the east, Lakhnauti in the west, and Satgaon in the south. Fakhruddin Mubarak \nShah became the independent Sultan of eastern Bengal with a realm covering Sonargaon, Sylhet, and Chittagong. His kingdom was powerful \nenough to withstand the kingdoms of Arakan and Tripura. The Moroccan traveler Ibn Battuta visited Sylhet during this period and met \nwith Fakhruddin Mubarak Shah and Shah Jalal. Fakhruddin was succeeded by his son Ikhtiyaruddin Ghazi Shah\n\n\nBengal Sultanate period:\n\nAfter the defeat of the last Sultans of Lakhnauti and Sonargaon between 1342 and 1352, Sylhet passed to the control of Shamsuddin Ilyas Shah\nwho unified a wider region into the Bengal Sultanate. Bengali Muslims were exploiting the fertile land of Sylhet for agricultural production\nand enjoyed relative prosperity innovating a contemporary agrarian society. \n\nIn 1384, a young Persian man by the name of Mirza Malik Muhammad Turani migrated to Sylhet with a large force and established the\nPratapgarh Kingdom (also including Deorali and Bhanugach) after marrying the daughter of the local ruler who had no children to take\nthe throne. The Kingdom was subordinate to the Maharaja Maha Manikya of the Manikya dynasty of Tripura.\n\n1486 marked the birth of Chaitanya whose ancestral homes are in Golapganj and Baniachong. Hindus believe Chaitanya was a reincarnation \nof Krishna and will return during the Kholi Zug. In 1499, a Persian nobleman from Isfahan known as Prince Sakhi Salamat settled in a rural \nvillage in South Sylhet known as Prithimpassa (now located in Kulaura). Being a wealthy nobleman; his son, Ismail Khan Lodhi, was granted\na jagir by the Mughals and given the status of Nawab in addition to other prestigious titles. In 1511, Alauddin Husain Shah's general Rukun \nKhan was made the governor of Sylhet. In 1512, Khan enlarged the dargah of Shah Jalal, according to an ancient Persian inscription. Khan \nwas succeeded by Gawhar Khan Aswari. \n\nDuring the rule of the Kangleipak King Khagemba, the King's brother, Prince Shalungba, was disappointed with Khagemba's treatment so he\nfled to the Sylhet region where he allied with Bengali Muslim leaders. With a contingent of Sylheti soldiers, Shalungba then attempted to\ninvade Manipur but the soldiers were captured and made to work as labourers in Manipur. These soldiers married local Manipuri women \nand adapted to the Meitei language. They introduced hookah to Manipur and founded the Pangal or Manipuri Muslim community.");

However, the leaders of the Reunion League, including\nMuhammad Bakht Mauzumdar and Syed Abdul Majid, later opposed the transfer \nof Sylhet and Cachar to Bengal during the Surma Valley Muslim Conference of \nSeptember 1928. This was supported by the Anjuman-e-Islamia and Muslim \nStudents Association. \n\nOn 23 March 1922, an anti-British mob took place at a madrasa in Kanaighat. The \nmadrasa was set to host their annual jalsa on the day but the British Raj had \noutlawed it and declared Section 144 throughout Kanaighat. The organisers were\nangered by the ban and subsequently violated Section 144 by leading a mob to\nattack the British commissioners. The armed British were able to conduct a swift\nvictory, by shooting down six people and injuring 38 people. The numbers of \nlascars grew between the two world wars, with some ending up in the docks of \nLondon and Liverpool. During World War II, many fought on the Allied front \nbefore settling down in the United Kingdom, where they opened cafes and \nrestaurants which became important hubs for the British Asian community. \n\nIn 1946, Gopinath Bordoloi, the Prime Minister of British Assam brought forward \nhis wish to hand over Sylhet back to East Bengal. Following a referendum, almost\nall of erstwhile district of Sylhet became a part of East Bengal in the Dominion of \nPakistan.
